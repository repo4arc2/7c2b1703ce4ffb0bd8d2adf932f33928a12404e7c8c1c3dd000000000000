00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,625
Some punishment. (GRUNTS)

164
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,791
I remember exactly what I did after that.

165
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,583
I went and had a nice, hot bath

166
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:08,250
and a glass of wine,
and I never thought about it again,

167
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,458
because it was just a bit of fun.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,333
-SIF: You.
-Huh?

169
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,333
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.
You did this.

170
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,208
Hang on. Ow.

171
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,166
I hope you know you deserve to be alone
and you always will be.

172
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,500
Just...

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,083
(GROANING)

174
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,333
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

175
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,375
Time loops. How lovely.

176
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,375
You.

177
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,166
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

178
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay. Okay, Sif. Hang on.

179
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,208
No, you hear this.
You deserve to be alone...

180
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,541
And I always will be.
All right, I get it.

181
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,541
Listen. You are a reconstruction
of a past event

182
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,125
created by the organization
that controls all of time.

183
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,791
So you need to trust me
and you need to help me escape. Yeah?

184
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, good.

185
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,416
Pathetic.

186
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,958
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

187
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,791
Hey.

188
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,500
(CHUCKLES)

189
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,583
Shouldn't you be interrogating
the Loki Variant?

190
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,416
He's softening in the Time Cell,

191
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,666
but while he marinates, I thought
maybe I'd interview the other Variant.

192
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,958
Oh, no. Just stick with your Loki
and figure out what that nexus spike was.

193
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,250
I know, but I think I can get there faster
if I work 'em both together.

194
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,000
You said we have a part to play,
and the part I play...

195
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,958
Absolutely not. She's just too dangerous.

196
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,000
Too dangerous? Come on, Ravonna.
This is what I do.

197
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,333
And this is what I do.

198
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,500
Nobody speaks with that Variant.

199
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,666
I mean, if there's a mastermind here,
I don't think it's Loki.

200
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,041
Good.

201
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,333
Then he should be the easiest to break.

202
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,333
Work your Loki and figure out
what caused that spike.

203
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,208
Time-Keepers are watching, Mobius.

204
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,500
They're always watching.
"Work your Loki, work your Loki."

205
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,083
That ought to be my mantra.

206
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,875
You all right?

207
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,833
-Is she in there?
-Mm-hmm.

208
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,916
(SCOFFS)

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They don't go gently, do they?

210
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,416
Aren't you supposed to be
interrogating your Variant pet?

211
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,625
Just stretching my legs.

212
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,000
You know, we brought in Kree,
Titans, vampires.

213
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,500
Why is it the two orphan demigods
are such a pain in the ass?

214
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,041
And yet it was your idea
to bring in another one.

215
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,458
I'm happy to share credit for that idea.

216
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,125
Mobius?

217
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,208
Did Loki say anything
while you were in there?

218
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,958
Yeah. He said the TVA is lying to me.

219
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,166
Why?

220
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,416
Just doing my job.

221
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,208
-SIF: You.
-(SIGHS)

222
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,791
You conniving, craven...

223
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,416
-Sif. Sif.
-...pathetic worm.

224
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,666
Please, please, no more.
Please, I beg you.

225
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,833
I'm a horrible person.
I get it. I really am.

226
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,916
I cut off your hair
because I thought it'd be funny.

227
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,041
And it's not.

228
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,750
Uh...

229
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,291
I crave attention...

230
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,083
because I'm...

231
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,375
(SIGHS)

232
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,875
I'm a... I'm a narcissist.

233
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,916
And I suppose it's...

234
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,333
It's because I'm scared of being alone.

235
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:21,375
You are alone and you always will be.

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,458
Okay, Loki.

237
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,083
You ready to talk?

238
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,875
Fancy technology.

239
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,458
Threatening interrogation tactics.

240
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,958
Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.

241
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,041
Well, there's been a lot of water
under the bridge since then.

242
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,125
LOKI: Certainly has.

243
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,625
Okay, you said the TVA is lying to me.
Go ahead.

244
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,541
Or is that just a cockroach's
survival mechanism kicking in?

245
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,291
Let me out of this place,
stop beating me up, and I'll tell you.

246
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,875
Cockroach. Got it.

247
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,333
How long have you been
working for the Variant?

248
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,750
Me? Working for her? Please.

249
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:27,291
If you're not working for the Variant,
what is it? You're partners?

250
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,708
Absolutely not.

251
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:34,458
She's difficult and irritating,

252
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,666
and she tries to hit me all the time.

253
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,375
No. Not partners, no.

254
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,375
Yeah, I guess you don't do partners.

255
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,333
Unless, of course, it benefits you,

256
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,708
and you intend to betray them
at some point.

257
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,125
It was a means to an end, Mobius.

258
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,833
Welcome to the real world.

259
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,250
Down there, we're awful
to get what we want.

260
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,333
Now I gotta have a prince tell me
how the real world works?

261
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,083
Why don't you just tell me what caused
the nexus event on Lamentis?

262
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,291
Let me say this again.

263
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,250
I'm not going to tell you

264
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,791
just so you can turn around
immediately afterwards and prune me.

265
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,875
I guess we've reached a dead end then.

266
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,000
Okay, it's over.

267
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm going to miss
these little tete-a-tetes.

268
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,625
LOKI: Me, too.

269
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,583
One guy playing checkers, you,
old Mobius playing chess,

270
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:23,250
but, yeah, give my regards to Lady Sif.

271
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,125
What... No. What? No, no, no.

272
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,083
Please, not...
Well, just wait, wait, wait.

273
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,208
Yeah?

274
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,416
Of course it was me
pulling the strings all along.

275
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:42,875
She came to me on Asgard a long time ago

276
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,875
and then she took me
to one of her apocalypses

277
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,458
and that's where
we hatched our plan together.

278
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,333
Which is?

279
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,708
Coming along very nicely, thank you.

280
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,958
MOBIUS: And the Variant?

281
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,000
Doesn't matter. She's a pawn.

282
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,000
Something very, very big is gonna happen.

283
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,958
And when it does, I'll dispose of her.

284
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,833
Well, we saved you the trouble there.

285
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,458
She's already been pruned.

286
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,333
-So assume I do set you free.
-Hang on, wait.

287
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:17,000
-What'd you just say?
-What? Assume I do set you free.

288
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,125
LOKI: The Variant. She's gone?

289
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,500
Yeah. Not before she took out two of ours.

290
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,291
Yeah, she was going
to her Time Cell, broke free.

291
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,750
Hunter B-15 stepped in, popped her.

292
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,500
So you might want to fire off
a thank you note to Hunter B-15,

293
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,916
because it looks like
you're the superior Loki.

294
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,708
I would've bet on her,
but that's what makes a horse race.

295
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,708
Good riddance.

296
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,666
(CHUCKLING)

297
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,000
-What's so funny?
-Come on.

298
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,791
Look at your eyes. You like her.

299
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,916
-What?
-You like her. Does she like you?

300
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,166
-LOKI: Was she pruned?
-No wonder you have no clue

301
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,875
what caused the nexus event
on Lamentis.

302
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,875
Both of you are swooning over each other.

00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,708
-LOKI: Tell me the truth.
-It's the apocalypse.

304
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,500
Two Variants of the same being,

305
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:18,458
especially you, forming this kind of sick,
twisted romantic relationship.

306
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,375
That's pure chaos.
That could break reality.

307
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,541
It's breaking my reality right now.

308
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:27,541
What a incredible seismic narcissist.

309
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,291
You fell for yourself.

310
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,916
Her name was Sylvie.

311
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,625
Ah, Sylvie.

312
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,250
Lovely.

313
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,125
How do you spell that?
Is that with an I-E or just an I?

314
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,500
Is she alive?

315
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,875
For now.

(SIGHS)

317
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,000
And was infiltrating the TVA,
was that always sort of the grand plan?

318
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,375
Our interests are aligned.

319
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,583
-MOBIUS: Overthrowing the Time-Keepers?
-Maybe they need to be overthrown.

320
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,916

is true, it affects all of us.

-Now, I'm supposed

-to believe your girlfriend.
-It's the truth.

329
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,916
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline,

330
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and erased your memories.

331

through enchantment.

maybe you had a family, a life.

That was good. You two, what a pair!

it's just death, destruction,

to close this case now,

we couldn't risk her escaping again.

She wouldn't have escaped.

Fine.

00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,458
I received word from the Time-Keepers.

373
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,875
They want to personally oversee
the Variant's pruning.

-It's great.
-Mission accomplished.

381

Mission accomplished.
It was just that she seemed fine when I...

382

When I saw her.
I mean, a little freaked, but fine.

Well, she quickly wasn't fine.

I'm trying to protect you.

Would you normally interview
someone like that? Yeah.

392
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,625
But the Variant scares the hell out of me,

393
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,041
and I didn't want to see
anything happen to you.

394
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,416
C-20 lost her mind.

395
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,333
She couldn't even form words by the end.

396
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:20,166
I just couldn't deal with that
happening to you or anyone else.

spending too much time with Lokis.

you brought us here?
